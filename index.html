	          <p><b>1. </b>The challenges the filmmakers anticipates in portraying Dr. Jose Rizal's life are doubtfulness and frustrations. At first the film makers are doubtful whether Rizal is a hero or been worthy of their time to do a movie about him (00:1:05). But after their thorough investigation realized it is impossible to make a movie about Rizal's life and it is more worthy to tell in books rather in movie (01:28:36).</p>
	          <p><b>2. </b>The main arguments presented regarding the validity of retraction documents are the document itself (00:07:13) that has been discovered by a Spanish priest in an archived room in 1935 (00:57:27), and the testimony of Father Balaguer (01:06:00). However, the retraction document may be fake and the signature of Rizal in that document may be forged (00:44:20) and on the first interview of Trinidad sister of Jose Rizal, she stated that the retraction didn't happen and there is no document showed to the family to support that Rizal really retracts (00:56:28), contrary to her last interview which she said that retraction really happened as she saw the retraction document (00:57:37).</p>
	          <p><b>3. </b>The film depicts Josephine Bracken's relationship with Rizal as like a melodrama, which the family didn't like her (00:37:30 and 00:39:10) but still Jose Rizal pursue her and choose to be with her, and even think to sign for a retraction document back when they were in Dapitan just to allow them to get married (00:40:19). Even Rizal's family didn't like her she till show her love to her Dear Jo (Jose Rizal) back then when they were in Dapitan, as Narcisa described her as caring and loving to Jose Rizal (00:15:41 and 00:50:30).</p>
	          <p><b>4. </b>The evidence that is provided to refute the claim is based on the interview of one of the Rizal's sister Trinidad stating that her brother didn't retract as they were no document that show to them as to support that claim (00:56:27). While, the evidences that are provided to support the claim are based on the account of a Spanish priest who found the retraction document in a archived room in 1935 (00:57:27), and also the other interview of Trining stating that her brother really retracts because of the document that has been discovered (00:58:37).</p>
	          <p><b>5. </b>The film explores the execution of Rizal from various perspectives, highlighting the conflicting narratives surrounding the event. One version portrays that he retracts and died as catholic while the other version portrays her dignified and defiant as he face the execution with courage and conviction of his beliefs (01:04:34).</p>
	          <p><b>6. </b>As the filmmakers go on with their investigation whether Rizal really retracts, one of them had a doubt on Rizal and questioned whether Rizal is really a hero or not. He argues that Rizal's alleged retraction and his reluctance to actively participate in the revolution cast doubt on his commitment to the cause of Philippine independence (01:02:59).</p>
	          <p><b>7. </b>The film depicts Jose Rizal's opposition on the wrong doing of Catholic Church as seen on his letter to her mother Donya Teodora (00:21:34). But the film also show the catholic side of Rizal on the account of Father Balaguer stating that Rizal retracts on the night before the execution (01:11:41).</p>
	          <p><b>8. </b>The technique use in this film which is a unique style of narration which they have a fictionalized conversations with Rizal affect the story telling very much. Because it allows for an intimate and personal exploration of Rizal's thoughts and feelings, and it also create the sense of immediacy and audience engagement (01:22:42).</p>
	          <p><b>9. </b>The specific issue that cause the filmmakers frustration is the lack of evidence for Jose Rizal's retraction issue. The filmmakers find themselves caught in a web of conflicting accounts and interpretations, making it difficult to arrive in a definite answer (01:01:55).</p>
	          <p><b>10. </b>The filmmakers interpret Rizal's impact on contemporary Philippine society as despite the controversies surrounding his life and the ongoing debates about his heroism, Rizal remains a powerful symbol of Philippine identity and a source of inspiration for generations of Filipinos. They emphasize his importance as a literary figure, a social reformer, and a champion of freedom (01:28:33).</p>

	          <p><b>1. </b>The accuracy in portrayal of Rizal in their film, as there are various accounts attributed only from speculations and some evidence with insufficient element that will classify as facts.</p>
	          <p><b>2. </b>Rizal's retraction are muddied by conflicting narratives between Father Balaguer and Rizal's family. Father Balaguer argues that Rizal a day before his execution retract and confess for his blasphemous and anti-clerical actions toward Catholic church, while his family do not believe he'll do that and require to see the document themselves which is found decades later.</p>
	          <p><b>3. </b>Rizal view her as kind, docile, and obedient woman, but his family hates her due to her nightly meetings in cathedral that raises suspicion that she is a confidant of Spain and the one to coax Rizal's view on Spanish government especially nearing Rizal's execution in Dapitan, and another thing is she couldn't prove her marriage with Rizal.</p>
	          <p><b>4. </b>Supporting evidence are his signature and later confirmation of Trining (Rizal's younger sister) about the authenticity of the document. The refute is that Father Balaguer doctored his signature, and his sister Trining refute that the document is not Rizal's during early interviews and the changed of her opinion was due to her old age.</p>
	          <p><b>5. </b>The first and well-acknowledged death was noble and heroic at it's telling, but the second one with retraction controversy if true show him as a coward, due to him going back to Catholicism, hating the masonry in which his image inspire the camaraderie, and throwing everything for a girl.</p>
	          <p><b>6. </b>His possible retraction, his not supporting the possible bloodshed revolution the KKK beckons him to join.</p>
	          <p><b>7. </b>As he traveled and lived in Europe and embark on his odyssey he learned a lot about our world and develop a pragmatic approach which lessen his faith on God and it's miracles, but as a kid he values those because his mother taught him to pray.</p>
	          <p><b>8. </b>It made the storytelling easy to follow, as myriad historical accounts sometimes overlap with each other. It made it easy to digest as well as some overlapping are necessary in my opinion to construe a complete event on Rizal's history.</p>
	          <p><b>9. </b>The retraction, because it's the nitty-gritty detail that classifies or unclassifies Rizal as embodiment of a hero, signifying selfless sacrifices for his ideals and countrymen that contributed greatly to country's liberation.</p>
	          <p><b>10. </b>The filmmakers somehow biases towards common narrative of Rizal's life deterring doubts to the mind after telling us stories that Rizal might be a conman as a hero. They weigh-in and conclude that the retraction is really unlikely to happen based on what he wrote, how others view him, and signifying the onset of revolution against Spanish government.</p>

          <p class="mt-3 text-center" style="width: 512px; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 2 rem;">Bayaning Third World is a film about film-makers trying to shoot their shot at creating a film about Philippine National Hero which is Rizal. Initially, the two film-makers brainstorm on what the film direction should be and later on settle with a detective story exploring in-depth countless accounts about Rizal's heroic deeds for his own country and countrymen. As the film nearing its end the film-makers struggle about particular event like Rizal's possible retraction and Bracken's possible coaxing to Rizal that made him turn aback, returning to Catholicism just to marry her. In a nutshell, the film-makers plants a seed of doubt to the audience mind and challenge their discretion on whether Rizal deserves his nobility, but by the end as a sort of disclaimer the film ends fortifying and validating the common conception of our idea of Rizal.</p>

	          <p><b>1. </b>The accuracy in portrayal of Rizal in their film, as there are various accounts attributed only from speculations and some evidence with insufficient element that will classify as facts.</p>
	          <p><b>2. </b>Rizal's retraction are muddied by conflicting narratives between Father Balaguer and Rizal's family. Father Balaguer argues that Rizal a day before his execution retract and confess for his blasphemous and anti-clerical actions toward Catholic church, while his family do not believe he'll do that and require to see the document themselves which is found decades later.</p>
	          <p><b>3. </b>Rizal view her as kind, docile, and obedient woman, but his family hates her due to her nightly meetings in cathedral that raises suspicion that she is a confidant of Spain and the one to coax Rizal's view on Spanish government especially nearing Rizal's execution in Dapitan, and another thing is she couldn't prove her marriage with Rizal.</p>
	          <p><b>4. </b>Supporting evidence are his signature and later confirmation of Trining (Rizal's younger sister) about the authenticity of the document. The refute is that Father Balaguer doctored his signature, and his sister Trining refute that the document is not Rizal's during early interviews and the changed of her opinion was due to her old age.</p>
	          <p><b>5. </b>The first and well-acknowledged death was noble and heroic at it's telling, but the second one with retraction controversy if true show him as a coward, due to him going back to Catholicism, hating the masonry in which his image inspire the camaraderie, and throwing everything for a girl.</p>
	          <p><b>6. </b>His possible retraction, his not supporting the possible bloodshed revolution the KKK beckons him to join.</p>
	          <p><b>7. </b>As he traveled and lived in Europe and embark on his odyssey he learned a lot about our world and develop a pragmatic approach which lessen his faith on God and it's miracles, but as a kid he values those because his mother taught him to pray.</p>
	          <p><b>8. </b>It made the storytelling easy to follow, as myriad historical accounts sometimes overlap with each other. It made it easy to digest as well as some overlapping are necessary in my opinion to construe a complete event on Rizal's history.</p>
	          <p><b>9. </b>The retraction, because it's the nitty-gritty detail that classifies or unclassifies Rizal as embodiment of a hero, signifying selfless sacrifices for his ideals and countrymen that contributed greatly to country's liberation.</p>
	          <p><b>10. </b>The filmmakers somehow biases towards common narrative of Rizal's life deterring doubts to the mind after telling us stories that Rizal might be a conman as a hero. They weigh-in and conclude that the retraction is really unlikely to happen based on what he wrote, how others view him, and signifying the onset of revolution against Spanish government.</p>

        <p class="text-center">Bayaning Third World is a film about film-makers trying to shoot their shot at creating a film about Philippine National Hero which is Rizal. Initially, the two film-makers brainstorm on what the film direction should be and later on settle with a detective story exploring in-depth countless accounts about Rizal's heroic deeds for his own country and countrymen. As the film nearing its end the film-makers struggle about particular event like Rizal's possible retraction and Bracken's possible coaxing to Rizal that made him turn aback, returning to Catholicism just to marry her. In a nutshell, the film-makers plants a seed of doubt to the audience mind and challenge their discretion on whether Rizal deserves his nobility, but by the end as a sort of disclaimer the film ends fortifying and validating the common conception of our idea of Rizal.</p>

          <h1>Rizal's Life</h1>
	  <p>JOSÉ RIZAL was born in Calamba, Philippines, in 1861, the son of a prosperous family, and was educated at the best schools and universities in Manila and in Europe. At the age of twenty-one, he left the Philippines to pursue medical and humanities studies in Spain, where he earned a degree in medicine with a specialty in ophthalmology. While in Spain, he worked with Philippine exiles to organize and develop groups opposed to the continuation of Spanish colonialism in the Philippines, though it has been argued that he never advocated complete independence. In Europe from 1882 to 1887, Rizal wrote his first novel, Noli Me Tangere, which he published in Berlin at his own expense. Upon returning to the Philippines, he was suspected of treason, so, in 1888, he returned to Europe, where he continued his anticolonial activities. In 1890, he published a new edition of Antonio de Morga’s Sucesos de las islas Filipinas (History of the Philippine Islands), a 1609 compendium of pre-Hispanic Philippine life and customs; and in 1891, Rizal’s second novel, El filibusterismo  (Subversion), was published. Upon returning to the Philippines that year, he was exiled to Dapitan, a town on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where he continued to write, practice medicine, and design public works. In 1896, when anticolonial hostilities broke out in the Spanish colony of Cuba, he volunteered to serve as a doctor for the Spanish army, perhaps to relieve himself of exile. Though his offer was accepted, before he was allowed to leave the Philippines, he was removed from the transport ship and imprisoned. Within days he was tried for treason and sentenced to death. On December 30, 1896, Rizal was executed by firing squad in Manila. During his life, José Rizal was an important member of the colonial opposition in the Philippines. After his death, he became the foremost symbol of Philippine nationalism.</p>

            <p class="scrollable-text">In more than a century since its appearance, José Rizal's Noli Me Tangere has become widely known as the great novel of the Philippines. A passionate love story set against the ugly political backdrop of repression, torture, and murder, "The Noli," as it is called in the Philippines, was the first major artistic manifestation of Asian resistance to European colonialism, and Rizal became a guiding conscience and martyr for the revolution that would subsequently rise up in the Spanish province.</p>

		    <p>Republic Act No. 1425 known as Rizal Law mandates all educational institution to teach life, works, and writings of José Rizal, It's primary aim is to inculcate students an increased sense of nationalism at a time when the Filipino identity is threatened by various factors.</p>
		    <p>The significance of the bill underlies on faulty identity of the Filipino due to centuries under the regime of Spanish and decades under in American and Japanese. During the proposition of the bill the Philippines is undergoing nation rebuilding and its legislators wants to acknowledge its country's heritage and heroes.</p>
		    <p>The bill faces opposition from both conservative groups and Catholic church due to Rizal's anti-clerical content of his novel that believes to maim the faith of people and the image of church. An archbishop of Manila Rufino Santos even wrote a pastoral letter of disagreement to the bill before it became a law, and various school of churches threaten to close operations due to it.</p>
		    <p>The proponents of the bill are Claro M. Recto whom believed that our youths must learn about Rizal's ideals and sacrifices for liberation and justice, and José P. Laurel whom seconds the bill and highlighted its educational value in fostering national consciousness.</p>
