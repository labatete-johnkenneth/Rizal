		  <p class="justify-text"><b>1. </b>The filmmakers who filmed Jose Rizal's life found it difficult to maintain the accuracy of Rizal's details. They grappled historically accurate, choosing pivotal moments and figuring out how to strike a balance between authenticity and dramatization. Creating a visual representation of his complex legacy proved difficult because, like with writing, it required difficult decisions to be both authentic and captivating in order to do him honor and maintain readers' interest. (1:25:00)</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>2. </b>The legitimacy of the retraction document may be questioned in the letters. supported by Father Balaguer's evidence (01:05:00) and searched for in 1935 (00:58:00). However, there are still questions over whether it could have been faked (00:43:00). Confusion and unruliness were increased when Rizal's sister Trinidad first denied seeing the evidence (00:55:00) but later changed her mind and claimed to have seen the document (00:59:00).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>3. </b>The connection between Josephine Bracken and Rizal is portrayed in the movie as contentious. Despite his family's disapproval (00:38:00, 00:40:00), he was unwavering. In fact, he considered going back to marry her (00:41:00). The love of Josephine persevered in spite of resistance. When Nihil went on to describe her care for Rizal during his exile, Narcisa herself finally acknowledged her commitment, demonstrating her sincerity even during this period (00:14:00, 00:49:00).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>4. </b>At first, however, Trinidad Rizal disputed it, even asserting that no document was ever seen (00:57:00). However, its accidental discovery in 1935 at 00:59:00 and her later confirmation that she had actually seen it at 01:00:00 support its veracity. The historical argument regarding the actual nature of Rizal's final ideas is still being fueled by contradictory testimony and a lack of definitive evidence.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>5. </b>However, there are two possible outcomes in the movie: either Rizal renounced his faith and died a devout Catholic, or he defied and bravely died with steely resolve (01:03:00). Such conflicting portrayals highlight differing opinions of his religious faith, beliefs, and unwavering dedication to the Filipino people, contributing to the long running historical debate on his final hours.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>6. </b>if Rizal is truly a hero in light of his purported retractions and lack of participation in the revolution (01:01:30). Rizal wanted reform without resorting to violence, in contrast to revolutionaries such as Bonifacio. It raises the question of whether Aguinaldo could have contributed even more to Philippine independence through direct activity on the revolutionary front if we accept that the passive methods he employed are enough.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>7. </b>Rizal's views on religion are still up for discussion. At 00:22:00, he denounced the injustices of the Catholic Church; yet, prior to his execution, Father Balaguer claimed to have changed his mind (01:10:00). Viewers can decide whether Rizal adhered to his convictions or made amends with the Church in his final moments by seeing the film, which includes both perspectives.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>8. </b>The movie expands on the plot and Rizal's feelings and ideas through made-up dialogue. This method combines historical facts with imaginative interpretation to produce an immersive experience. Because the narrative is more appropriate and near to Rizal, audiences in the present era will find his hardships, values, and motivations more accessible and powerful (01:21:00).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>9. </b>The filmmakers struggled with different interpretations of Rizal's retractions (01:00:30). Some claim it occurred, while others deny it. They were frustrated since there was no concrete proof that this existed or was ever put into practice. This is because historical interpreters are frequently forced to sort through the facts that are completely untrue. It serves as a reminder that any long-held historical narrative is always subject to revision in light of new information or historical reinterpretations, rendering historically accurate findings erratic and the focus of contentious discussion centuries after the fact.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>10. </b>Despite his various controversies, Rizal remains a national icon. His legacy continues to shape Philippine identity, according to the filmmakers (01:27:00). His work and sacrifices inspire generations, and he played a part in reawakening nationalism. His efforts to independence, reform, and education, in any case, surely influenced Philippine society and are essential to its history, culture, and sense of national identity.</p>

	          <p class="justify-text"><b>1. </b>The challenges the filmmakers anticipates in portraying Dr. Jose Rizal's life are doubtfulness and frustrations. At first the film makers are doubtful whether Rizal is a hero or been worthy of their time to do a movie about him (00:1:05). But after their thorough investigation realized it is impossible to make a movie about Rizal's life and it is more worthy to tell in books rather in movie (01:28:36).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>2. </b>The main arguments presented regarding the validity of retraction documents are the document itself (00:07:13) that has been discovered by a Spanish priest in an archived room in 1935 (00:57:27), and the testimony of Father Balaguer (01:06:00). However, the retraction document may be fake and the signature of Rizal in that document may be forged (00:44:20) and on the first interview of Trinidad sister of Jose Rizal, she stated that the retraction didn't happen and there is no document showed to the family to support that Rizal really retracts (00:56:28), contrary to her last interview which she said that retraction really happened as she saw the retraction document (00:57:37).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>3. </b>The film depicts Josephine Bracken's relationship with Rizal as like a melodrama, which the family didn't like her (00:37:30 and 00:39:10) but still Jose Rizal pursue her and choose to be with her, and even think to sign for a retraction document back when they were in Dapitan just to allow them to get married (00:40:19). Even Rizal's family didn't like her she till show her love to her Dear Jo (Jose Rizal) back then when they were in Dapitan, as Narcisa described her as caring and loving to Jose Rizal (00:15:41 and 00:50:30).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>4. </b>The evidence that is provided to refute the claim is based on the interview of one of the Rizal's sister Trinidad stating that her brother didn't retract as they were no document that show to them as to support that claim (00:56:27). While, the evidences that are provided to support the claim are based on the account of a Spanish priest who found the retraction document in a archived room in 1935 (00:57:27), and also the other interview of Trining stating that her brother really retracts because of the document that has been discovered (00:58:37).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>5. </b>The film explores the execution of Rizal from various perspectives, highlighting the conflicting narratives surrounding the event. One version portrays that he retracts and died as catholic while the other version portrays her dignified and defiant as he face the execution with courage and conviction of his beliefs (01:04:34).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>6. </b>As the filmmakers go on with their investigation whether Rizal really retracts, one of them had a doubt on Rizal and questioned whether Rizal is really a hero or not. He argues that Rizal's alleged retraction and his reluctance to actively participate in the revolution cast doubt on his commitment to the cause of Philippine independence (01:02:59).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>7. </b>The film depicts Jose Rizal's opposition on the wrong doing of Catholic Church as seen on his letter to her mother Donya Teodora (00:21:34). But the film also show the catholic side of Rizal on the account of Father Balaguer stating that Rizal retracts on the night before the execution (01:11:41).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>8. </b>The technique use in this film which is a unique style of narration which they have a fictionalized conversations with Rizal affect the story telling very much. Because it allows for an intimate and personal exploration of Rizal's thoughts and feelings, and it also create the sense of immediacy and audience engagement (01:22:42).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>9. </b>The specific issue that cause the filmmakers frustration is the lack of evidence for Jose Rizal's retraction issue. The filmmakers find themselves caught in a web of conflicting accounts and interpretations, making it difficult to arrive in a definite answer (01:01:55).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>10. </b>The filmmakers interpret Rizal's impact on contemporary Philippine society as despite the controversies surrounding his life and the ongoing debates about his heroism, Rizal remains a powerful symbol of Philippine identity and a source of inspiration for generations of Filipinos. They emphasize his importance as a literary figure, a social reformer, and a champion of freedom (01:28:33).</p>

	          <p class="justify-text"><b>1. </b>As presented at (00:01:05) a challenge that the filmmakers encountered was on how they can properly portray Dr. Jose Rizal’s life through their film. According to them, after understanding and researching, it is much easier to portray Rizal’s life with writings rather than movies (at 01:27:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>2. </b>The main arguments about the validity of the retraction document include the document itself (at 00:07:13), which was discovered by a Spanish priest in an archive room in 1935 (at 00:57:00), and the testimony of Father Balaguer at (01:06:00). However, doubts remain, as the document may be fake, and Rizal’s signature could have been forged at (00:44:00). In her first interview, Rizal’s sister Trinidad claimed that the retraction never happened and that no document was shown to the family as proof ( at 00:56:28). Yet, in a later interview, she contradicted this by stating that the retraction did occur, as she had seen the document herself (at 00:57:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>3. </b>The film portrays Josephine Bracken’s relationship with Rizal as a melodrama, showing that his family didn’t like her ( as shown in 00:37:30, 00:39:10), yet Rizal still chose to be with her. He even considered signing a retraction document while they were in Dapitan (at 40:00) so they could marry. Despite the family's disapproval, Josephine continued to express her love for Rizal, whom she called "Dear Jo." Narcisa even described her as caring and devoted to him during their time in Dapitan (at 00:15:00 and 00:50:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>4. </b>The evidence refuting the retraction claim comes from an interview with Rizal’s sister, Trinidad, in which she stated that her brother did not retract, as no document was ever shown to the family to support that claim (at 00:56:00). On the other hand, the evidence supporting the retraction includes the account of a Spanish priest who discovered the retraction document in an archive room in 1935 (at 00:57:00), as well as another interview with Trinidad, where she later stated that Rizal did retract after the document was found (at 00:58:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>5. </b>The film examines Rizal’s execution from multiple perspectives, emphasizing the conflicting narratives surrounding the event. One version depicts him retracting and dying as a Catholic, while another presents him as dignified and defiant, facing his execution with courage and unwavering conviction in his beliefs (at 01:04:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>6. </b>As the filmmakers continued their investigation into whether Rizal truly retracted, one of them began to doubt Rizal and questioned if he was truly a hero. He argued that Rizal's supposed retraction and his reluctance to actively join the revolution raised doubts about his dedication to the fight for Philippine independence (at 01:02:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>7. </b>The film portrays Jose Rizal’s criticism of the Catholic Church’s wrongdoings, as reflected in his letter to his mother, Doña Teodora (at 00:21:00). However, it also presents the Catholic perspective of Rizal through Father Balaguer’s account, which claims that Rizal retracted the night before his execution (at 01:11:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>8. </b>The film shows a unique narrative technique by incorporating fictionalized conversations with Rizal, which significantly enhances the storytelling. This approach allows for a more intimate and personal exploration of Rizal’s thoughts and emotions while also engaging the audience more deeply (at 01:22:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>9. </b>The filmmakers' frustration stems from the lack of concrete evidence regarding Jose Rizal’s retraction. They find themselves entangled in conflicting accounts and interpretations, making it challenging to reach a definitive conclusion (at 01:01:00).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>10. </b>The filmmakers view Rizal’s impact on contemporary Philippine society as enduring, despite the controversies surrounding his life and the debates about his heroism, phe remained a powerful symbol of Philippine identity and a source of inspiration for generations (at 01:28:00).</p>

Father Balaguer argues that Rizal a day before his execution retract and confess for his blasphemous and anti-clerical actions toward Catholic church, while his family do not believe he'll do that and require to see the document themselves which is found decades later.</p>

	          <p class="justify-text"><b>4. </b>Supporting evidence are his signature and later confirmation of Trining (Rizal's younger sister) about the authenticity of the document.

	          <p class="justify-text"><b>10. </b>The filmmakers somehow biases towards common narrative of Rizal's life deterring doubts to the mind after telling us stories that Rizal might be a conman as a hero. They weigh-in and conclude that the retraction is really unlikely to happen based on what he wrote, how others view him, and signifying the onset of revolution against Spanish government.</p>

          <p class="mt-3 mx-5 justify-text">Bayaning Third World is a film about film-makers trying to shoot their shot at creating a film about Philippine National Hero which is Rizal. Initially, the two film-makers brainstorm on what the film direction should be and later on settle with a detective story exploring in-depth countless accounts about Rizal's heroic deeds for his own country and countrymen. As the film nearing its end the film-makers struggle about particular event like Rizal's possible retraction and Bracken's possible coaxing to Rizal that made him turn aback, returning to Catholicism just to marry her. In a nutshell, the film-makers plants a seed of doubt to the audience mind and challenge their discretion on whether Rizal deserves his nobility, but by the end as a sort of disclaimer the film ends fortifying and validating the common conception of our idea of Rizal.</p>

		  <p class="justify-text"><b>1. </b>The filmmakers who filmed Jose Rizal's life found it difficult to maintain the accuracy of Rizal's details. They grappled historically accurate, choosing pivotal moments and figuring out how to strike a balance between authenticity and dramatization. Creating a visual representation of his complex legacy proved difficult because, like with writing, it required difficult decisions to be both authentic and captivating in order to do him honor and maintain readers' interest. (1:25:00)</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>2. </b>The legitimacy of the retraction document may be questioned in the letters. supported by Father Balaguer's evidence (01:05:00) and searched for in 1935 (00:58:00). However, there are still questions over whether it could have been faked (00:43:00). Confusion and unruliness were increased when Rizal's sister Trinidad first denied seeing the evidence (00:55:00) but later changed her mind and claimed to have seen the document (00:59:00).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>3. </b>The connection between Josephine Bracken and Rizal is portrayed in the movie as contentious. Despite his family's disapproval (00:38:00, 00:40:00), he was unwavering. In fact, he considered going back to marry her (00:41:00). The love of Josephine persevered in spite of resistance. When Nihil went on to describe her care for Rizal during his exile, Narcisa herself finally acknowledged her commitment, demonstrating her sincerity even during this period (00:14:00, 00:49:00).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>4. </b>At first, however, Trinidad Rizal disputed it, even asserting that no document was ever seen (00:57:00). However, its accidental discovery in 1935 at 00:59:00 and her later confirmation that she had actually seen it at 01:00:00 support its veracity. The historical argument regarding the actual nature of Rizal's final ideas is still being fueled by contradictory testimony and a lack of definitive evidence.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>5. </b>However, there are two possible outcomes in the movie: either Rizal renounced his faith and died a devout Catholic, or he defied and bravely died with steely resolve (01:03:00). Such conflicting portrayals highlight differing opinions of his religious faith, beliefs, and unwavering dedication to the Filipino people, contributing to the long running historical debate on his final hours.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>6. </b>if Rizal is truly a hero in light of his purported retractions and lack of participation in the revolution (01:01:30). Rizal wanted reform without resorting to violence, in contrast to revolutionaries such as Bonifacio. It raises the question of whether Aguinaldo could have contributed even more to Philippine independence through direct activity on the revolutionary front if we accept that the passive methods he employed are enough.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>7. </b>Rizal's views on religion are still up for discussion. At 00:22:00, he denounced the injustices of the Catholic Church; yet, prior to his execution, Father Balaguer claimed to have changed his mind (01:10:00). Viewers can decide whether Rizal adhered to his convictions or made amends with the Church in his final moments by seeing the film, which includes both perspectives.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>8. </b>The movie expands on the plot and Rizal's feelings and ideas through made-up dialogue. This method combines historical facts with imaginative interpretation to produce an immersive experience. Because the narrative is more appropriate and near to Rizal, audiences in the present era will find his hardships, values, and motivations more accessible and powerful (01:21:00).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>9. </b>The filmmakers struggled with different interpretations of Rizal's retractions (01:00:30). Some claim
it occurred, while others deny it. They were frustrated since there was no concrete proof that this existed or was ever put into practice. This is because historical interpreters are frequently forced to sort through the facts that are completely untrue. It serves as a reminder that any long-held historical narrative is always subject to revision in light of new information or historical reinterpretations, rendering historically accurate findings erratic and the focus of contentious discussion centuries after the fact.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>10. </b>Despite his various controversies, Rizal remains a national icon. His legacy continues to shape
Philippine identity, according to the filmmakers (01:27:00). His work and sacrifices inspire generations, and he played a part in reawakening nationalism. His efforts to independence, reform, and education, in any case, surely influenced Philippine society and are essential to its history, culture, and sense of national identity.</p>

	          <p class="justify-text"><b>2. </b>The main arguments presented regarding the validity of retraction documents are the document itself (00:07:13) that has been discovered by a Spanish priest in an archived room in 1935 (00:57:27), and the testimony of Father Balaguer (01:06:00). However, the retraction document may be fake and the signature of Rizal in that document may be forged (00:44:20) and on the first interview of Trinidad sister of Jose Rizal, she stated that the retraction didn't happen and there is no document showed to the family to support that Rizal really retracts (00:56:28), contrary to her last interview which she said that retraction really happened as she saw the retraction document (00:57:37).</p>

Even Rizal's family didn't like her she till show her love to her Dear Jo (Jose Rizal) back then when they were in Dapitan, as Narcisa described her as caring and loving to Jose Rizal (00:15:41 and 00:50:30).</p>

One version portrays that he retracts and died as catholic while the other version portrays her dignified and defiant as he face the execution with courage and conviction of his beliefs (01:04:34).</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>6. </b>As the filmmakers go on with their investigation whether Rizal really retracts, one of them had a doubt on Rizal and questioned whether Rizal is really a hero or not. He argues that Rizal's alleged retraction and his reluctance to actively participate in the revolution cast doubt on his commitment to the cause of Philippine independence (01:02:59).</p>

However, doubts remain, as the document may be fake, and Rizal’s signature could have been forged at (00:44:00). In her first interview, Rizal’s sister Trinidad claimed that the retraction never happened and that no document was shown to the family as proof ( at 00:56:28). Yet, in a later interview, she contradicted this by stating that the retraction did occur, as she had seen the document herself (at 00:57:00).</p>

Despite the family's disapproval, Josephine continued to express her love for Rizal, whom she called "Dear Jo."

On the other hand, the evidence supporting the retraction includes the account of a Spanish priest who discovered the retraction document in an archive room in 1935 (at 00:57:00), as well as another interview with Trinidad, where she later stated that Rizal did retract after the document was found (at 00:58:00).</p>

		  <p class="justify-text"><b>3. </b>Rizal’s family didn’t approve of Josephine, but he loved her and even considered retracting his beliefs to marry her (00:37:30, 00:39:10, 00:40:19). Josephine stayed devoted to Rizal and cared for him deeply (00:15:41, 00:50:30).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>4. </b>Against: Rizal’s sister Trinidad initially said there was no proof of a retraction (00:56:27). For: A Spanish priest claimed to have found a retraction document in 1935, and later, Trinidad said she saw it (00:57:27, 00:58:37).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>5. </b>One version says Rizal retracted and died as a Catholic. Another says he stayed true to his beliefs until the end (01:04:34). This shows how history can be unclear and open to different interpretations.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>6. </b>One filmmaker questions if Rizal is a hero because he didn’t join the revolution physically (01:02:59). He wonders if writing alone is enough to make someone a hero.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>7. </b>Rizal criticized the Church’s wrongdoings in a letter to his mother (00:21:34). However, a priest claimed Rizal returned to the Church before he died (01:11:41).</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>8. </b>The filmmakers use fictional interviews with Rizal, making the story feel more personal (01:22:42). This helps the audience connect with his thoughts and struggles.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>9. </b>They can’t find clear proof about Rizal’s retraction because the accounts contradict each other (01:01:55). This makes it hard to know the absolute truth.</p>
		  <p class="justify-text"><b>10. </b>Despite debates about his life, Rizal remains a symbol of Filipino pride (01:28:33). His writings and fight for freedom continue to inspire people today.</p>

	          <p class="justify-text"><b>1. </b>The filmmakers anticipate challenges in separating fact from fiction, as well as dealing with the complexities and controversies surrounding Rizal’s life. They also worry about how to make the film engaging and relevant to a modern audience. (1:25:00 )</p>
	          <p class="justify-text"><b>2. </b>Some argue that the retraction document is authentic, citing its existence in the Spanish archives. ( 57:27 ).

        <p class="justify-text">Bayaning Third World is a film about film-makers trying to shoot their shot at creating a film about Philippine National Hero which is Rizal. Initially, the two film-makers brainstorm on what the film direction should be and later on settle with a detective story exploring in-depth countless accounts about Rizal's heroic deeds for his own country and countrymen. As the film nearing its end the film-makers struggle about particular event like Rizal's possible retraction and Bracken's possible coaxing to Rizal that made him turn aback, returning to Catholicism just to marry her. In a nutshell, the film-makers plants a seed of doubt to the audience mind and challenge their discretion on whether Rizal deserves his nobility, but by the end as a sort of disclaimer the film ends fortifying and validating the common conception of our idea of Rizal.</p>

          <h1>Rizal's Life</h1>
	  <p class="justify-text">JOSÉ RIZAL was born in Calamba, Philippines, in 1861, the son of a prosperous family, and was educated at the best schools and universities in Manila and in Europe. At the age of twenty-one, he left the Philippines to pursue medical and humanities studies in Spain, where he earned a degree in medicine with a specialty in ophthalmology. While in Spain, he worked with Philippine exiles to organize and develop groups opposed to the continuation of Spanish colonialism in the Philippines, though it has been argued that he never advocated complete independence. In Europe from 1882 to 1887, Rizal wrote his first novel, Noli Me Tangere, which he published in Berlin at his own expense. Upon returning to the Philippines, he was suspected of treason, so, in 1888, he returned to Europe, where he continued his anticolonial activities. In 1890, he published a new edition of Antonio de Morga’s Sucesos de las islas Filipinas (History of the Philippine Islands), a 1609 compendium of pre-Hispanic Philippine life and customs; and in 1891, Rizal’s second novel, El filibusterismo  (Subversion), was published. Upon returning to the Philippines that year, he was exiled to Dapitan, a town on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where he continued to write, practice medicine, and design public works. In 1896, when anticolonial hostilities broke out in the Spanish colony of Cuba, he volunteered to serve as a doctor for the Spanish army, perhaps to relieve himself of exile. Though his offer was accepted, before he was allowed to leave the Philippines, he was removed from the transport ship and imprisoned. Within days he was tried for treason and sentenced to death. On December 30, 1896, Rizal was executed by firing squad in Manila. During his life, José Rizal was an important member of the colonial opposition in the Philippines. After his death, he became the foremost symbol of Philippine nationalism.</p>

		    <p>Republic Act No. 1425 known as Rizal Law mandates all educational institution to teach life, works, and writings of José Rizal, It's primary aim is to inculcate students an increased sense of nationalism at a time when the Filipino identity is threatened by various factors.</p>
		    <p>The significance of the bill underlies on faulty identity of the Filipino due to centuries under the regime of Spanish and decades under in American and Japanese.
